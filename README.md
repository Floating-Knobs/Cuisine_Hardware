Cuisine is a powerful open source platform to develop your very own sequencer or controller application.

The design is based on an Atmega4809 and Arduino compatible, so you can simply use the Arduino IDE to program it.

A large choice of compatible libraries is available, allowing for seamless implementation of functionalities.

You can start with the [MegaCoreX](https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX) , it will be needed to program Cuisine with the Arduino IDE.

Our own libraries will be released for the specific hardware features of Cuisine, ensuring optimal performance and ease of use for developers.
Do not hesitate to let me know wich ones to prioritize.

Library planned for release :
- Endless potentiometer
- Keyboard
- Gate input
